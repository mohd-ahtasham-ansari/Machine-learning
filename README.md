# 🚀 My Machine Learning Journey
*"Turning data into intelligence, one step at a time."*

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository!  
This is where I document my learning path — from the basics of Python libraries to real-world ML projects.  

---

## 🔥 What I’ve Learned So Far
- 🧮 **NumPy** → numerical computations & arrays  
- 📊 **Pandas** → data analysis, cleaning & manipulation  
- 📉 **Matplotlib** → data visualizations & plots  
- 🎨 **Seaborn** → advanced statistical visuals

## ⏭️ What’s Coming Next
- 📂 Data handling & preprocessing (missing values, scaling, encoding)  
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🧠 Math for ML (linear algebra, probability, stats, calculus basics)  
- 🤖 First ML models and algorithms
